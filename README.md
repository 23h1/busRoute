# <a href="https://github.com/23h1/busroute"> Bus route </a>

A simple utility to animate a bus route using a marker (over bus stops)

When time permits, I'd like to build on this to explore Mapbox APIs further.

To do:
- Persist the markers at the bus stop(s) as the animation moves from stop to stop.
- draw a line as the marker moves from one bus stop to another.

The route here is from Bournemouth railway station to Bourneouth Uni.
