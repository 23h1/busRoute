# Marking a Bus route

A simple utility to animate a bus route by placing a marker over the bus stops.

When time permits, I'd like to build on this to explore Mapbox APIs further.

To see this work, simply clone this repo and load the Index.html into the browser and hit the button `Show stops between Bournemouth station to Bournemouth University`

To do:
- Persist the markers at the bus stop(s) as the animation moves from stop to stop.
- draw a line as the marker moves from one bus stop to another.

The route here is from Bournemouth railway station to Bourneouth Uni.
